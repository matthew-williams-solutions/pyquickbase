# Roadmap

What's left to do. Delete an item once it's done: `CHANGELOG.md` and git history record what's
finished, and `docs/api-notes.md` records what's been confirmed about Quickbase. Limits we've decided
to keep are explained in the guides, not here.

## Before 1.0

- Release a candidate with schema plans, `feature/schema-changes`, then let it run for at least a week
  with no code changes.
- Check the formula functions a client with read rules allows, `SAFE_FUNCTIONS` in `_formula.py`,
  against Quickbase's function list. A missing one is refused by name, so this only widens what's
  allowed, but each one added must only read the record's own values.
- A plan checks a table it creates against the client's limits only when it's applied, so a change to
  that table can still be refused partway through. Planning again resumes from there.
- `ReadRules` hide every summary's filter (`Field.summary_query`), as a field's details don't say which
  table the filter reads, so an existing summary is matched without it. The planned `Policy` binds
  relationships, so it can show a filter whose fields are readable.
- In the 1.0 release commit:
  - Change the classifier in `pyproject.toml` from Beta to Production/Stable.
  - Remove the release candidate warnings from `README.md` and `docs/index.md`, and the advice to pin
    the exact version. If the pins go too, update `test_install_pins_match_the_version`.
  - If codegen's output has changed, refresh `tests/fixtures/generated_tables.py` one last time.

## After 1.0

Nothing here should break anyone.

- Switch the docs from Material to Zensical, **by 2027-05-05**, when Material's maintenance ends. A
  trial build of 0.0.74 worked, and its strict mode also catches broken anchors, which MkDocs doesn't.
  Wait for 0.1.0, announced for 2026-11-05. `scripts/build_llms.py` reads the nav from
  `mkdocs.yml`, so update it if the config moves.
- `llms.txt` is at `/pyquickbase/llms.txt`, not the domain root where some tools look, because the
  site is served from a subpath. Only a custom domain would change that.
- A small config file to choose generated names.
- A setting that repeats a typed table's schema check after a set time.

## Demo app

The Quickbase demo app and its Python code page, which is kept outside this repo. Do these before anyone
else gets access, because the page writes with the viewer's own permissions:

- Pin the SDK version the page loads, and verify the downloaded files where possible. It currently
  loads whichever wheel the docs site lists.
- Block the Python frame from navigating away with data in the address, or disclose it plainly. The page
  closes the frame after it navigates, which is too late to stop the data leaving.
- Decide who gets access, and whether their writes should be limited. Anyone who can add and delete
  tasks can also run Reset tasks, which replaces the Tasks records for everyone.
- Find out which roles can add a code page. The help only says "app builders".
- Keep Overdue Tasks from drifting. The sample due dates are fixed, so the number climbs over time.

## Open questions

Nothing is waiting on these. Test one against a sandbox app before depending on the answer, then move
the result to `docs/api-notes.md`.

**Queries and limits**

- Which endpoints have different rate limits?
- Do other realms have a different request size limit? Seven endpoints share the one in the
  [API notes](docs/api-notes.md#file-attachments).

**Realms and apps**

- Does the new interface have a link to the records that match a filter, or does the classic
  `/db/<table ID>?a=q&query=<filter>` still redirect to one? If so, add a filtered link built from
  `compile_where()`.

- Is `api.quickbase.eu` the API host for EU realms? It answers without a token just as `api.quickbase.com`
  does, and the help only says EU realms use `.quickbase.eu`. Confirming it needs a real EU realm.
